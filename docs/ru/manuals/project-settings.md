title: Defold project settings
brief: This manual describes how project specific settings work in Defold.
---

# Project settings

The file *game.project* contains all project wide settings. It must stay in the root folder of the project and must be named *game.project*. The first thing the engine does when starting up and launching your game is look for this file.

Every setting in the file belongs to a category. When you open the file Defold presents all settings grouped by category.

![Project settings](images/project-settings/settings.jpg)

Below are all the available settings, arranged by section. Some settings are not yet exposed in the settings editor (these are marked "hidden setting" below), but can be set manually by right clicking "game.project" and selecting <kbd>Open With â–¸ Text Editor</kbd>.

## Project

Title
: The title of the application.

Version
: The version of the application.

Write Log
: When checked, the engine will write a log file *log.txt* in the project root. When running on iOS, the log file can be accessed through iTunes and the *Apps* tab and the *File Sharing* section. On Android, the file is stored in the app's external storage. When running the *dmengine* development app, you can view the log with:

```bash
$ adb shell cat /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.defold.dmengine/files/log.txt
```

Compress Archive
: Enables compression of archives when bundling. Note that this currently applies to all platforms except Android where the apk already contains all data compressed.

Dependencies
: A list of URLs to the project *Library URL*s. For Defold hosted projects, the URL is found on the project page on the [Dashboard](//dashboard.defold.com)). Note that you need read access to the URL. For Defold hosted projects, that means you need to be a member of the dependent projects.

Custom Resources
: A comma separated list of resources that will be included in the project. If directories are specified, all files and directories in that directory are recursively included.

_bundle_resources_ (hidden setting)
: A directory containing resource files and folders that should be copied as-is into the resulting package when bundling. The directory is specified with an absolute path from the project root, for example `/res`. The resource directory must contain subfolders named by `platform`, or `architecure-platform`.

  :[platforms](../shared/platforms.md)

  A subfolder named `common` is also allowed, containing resource files common for all platforms.

_bundle_exclude_resources_ (hidden setting)
: A comma separated list of resources that should not be included in the bundle.

## Bootstrap

Main Collection
: File reference of the collection to use for starting the application, `/logic/main.collection` by default.

Render
: Which render setup file to use, which defines the render pipeline, `/builtins/render/default.render` by default.

## Library

## Display

Width
: The width in pixels of the application window, `960` by default.

Height
: The height in pixels of the application window, `640` by default.

High Dpi
: Creates a high dpi back buffer on displays that support it. Typically the game will render in double the resolution than what is set in the *Width* and *Height* settings, which will still be the logical resolution used in scripts and properties.

Samples
: How many samples to use for super sampling anti-aliasing. It sets the GLFW_FSAA_SAMPLES window hint. It is `0` by default, which means that anti-aliasing is turned off.

Fullscreen
: Check if the application should start full screen. If unchecked, the application runs windowed.

Update Frequency
: Frame update frequency, `60` by default. Valid values are `60`, `30`, `20`, `15`, `12`, `10`, `6`, `5`, `4`, `3`, `2` or `1`.

Variable Dt

Gravity Z
: World gravity along z-axis, `0` by default.

Scale
: Tells the physics engine how to scale the physics worlds in relation to the game world for numerical precision, `0.01`--`1.0`. If the value is set to `0.02`, it means that the physics engine will view 50 units as 1 meter ($1 / 0.02$). The default value is `1.0`.

: If set, use the specified CSS file when bundling.

Splash Image
: If set, use the specified splash image on startup when bundling.

Archive Location Prefix
: When bundling for HTML5 game data is split up into one or more archive data files. When the engine starts the game, these archive files are read into memory. Use this setting to specify the location of the data, `archive` by default.

Archive Location Suffix
: Suffix to be appended to the archive files. Useful to, for instance, force non-cached content from a CDN (`?version2` for example).

## Facebook

Appid
: The application id as issued by Facebook.

## IAP

Auto Finish Transactions
: Check to automatically finish IAP transactions. If unchecked, you need to explicitly call `iap.finish()` after a successful transaction, checked by default.

## Live update

Private Key
: If set, use the specified private key file when bundling live update content. If no key file is set, a key is generated.

Public Key
: If set, use the specified public key file when bundling live update content. If no key file is set, a key is generated.

## Native extension

_App Manifest (alpha state)_
: If set, use the app manifest to customize the engine build. This allows you to remove unneeded parts from the engine making it possible to decrease the final binary size. Note that this feature is in alpha state. Please visit [the forum](https://forum.defold.com/t/native-extensions/4946/142) for information on how to proceed.

## Profiler

Track Cpu
: If checked, enable CPU profiling in release versions of the builds. Normally, you can only access profiling information in debug builds.

## File format

The format of the settings file is simple text and can be edited by any standard text editor. The format looks like this:

```ini
[category1]
setting1 = value
setting2 = value
[category2]
...
```

A real example is:

```ini
[bootstrap]
main_collection = /main/main.collectionc
```

which means that the setting *main_collection* belongs to the *bootstrap* category.
Whenever a file reference is used, like the example above, the path needs to be appended with a 'c' character, which means you're referencing the compiled version of the file.
Also note that the folder containing *game.project* will be the project root, which is why there is an initial '/' in the setting path.

## Setting config values on engine startup

When the engine starts, it is possible to provide config values from the command line that override the *game.project* settings:

```bash
# Specify a bootstap collection
$ dmengine --config=bootstrap.main_collection=/my.collectionc

# Set two custom config values
$ dmengine --config=test.my_value=4711 --config=test2.my_value2=1234
```

Custom values can---just like any other config value---be read with [`sys.get_config()`](/ref/sys/#sys.get_config):

```lua
local my_value = tonumber(sys.get_config("test.my_value")) 
```

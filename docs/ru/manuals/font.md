title: Fonts in Defold manual
brief: This manual describes how Defold handles fonts and how to bring fonts onto the screen in your games.

# Font files

Fonts are used to render text on Label components and GUI text nodes. Defold supports several font file formats:

- TrueType
- OpenType
- BMFont

Fonts added to your project are automatically converted into a texture format that Defold can render. Two font rendering techniques are available, each with its own specific benefits and drawbacks:

- Bitmap
- Distance field

## Creating a font

To create a font for use in Defold, create a new Font file by selecting <kbd>File ▸ New...</kbd> from the menu, then select <kbd>Font</kbd>. You can also <kbd>right click</kbd> a location in the *Assets* browser and select <kbd>New... ▸ Font</kbd>.

![New font name](images/font/new_font_name.png){srcset="images/font/new_font_name@2x.png 2x"}

Give the new font file a name and click <kbd>Ok</kbd>. The new font file now opens in the editor.

![New font](images/font/new_font.png){srcset="images/font/new_font@2x.png 2x"}

Drag the font you wish to use into the *Assets* browser and drop it in a good spot.

Set the *Font* property to the font file and set the font properties as needed.

## Properties

*Font*
: The TTF, OTF or *.fnt* file to use for generating the font data.

*Material*
: The material to use when rendering this font. Make sure to change this for distance field and BMFonts (see below for details).

*Output Format*
: The type of font data that is generated.

  - `TYPE_BITMAP` converts the imported OTF or TTF file into a font sheet texture where the bitmap data is used to render text nodes. The color channels are used to encode the face shape, outline and drop shadow. For *.fnt* files, the source texture bitmap is used as is.
  - `TYPE_DISTANCE_FIELD` The imported font is converted into a font sheet texture where the pixel data represents not screen pixels but distances to the font edge. See below for details.

*Size*
: The target size of the glyphs in pixels.

*Antialias*
: If the font should be antialiased when baked onto the target bitmap. Set to 0 if you want pixel perfect font rendering.

*Alpha*
: The transparency of the glyph. 0.0--1.0 where 0.0 means transparent and 1.0 opaque.

*Outline Alpha*
: The transparency of the generated outline. 0.0--1.0.

*Outline Width*
: The width of the generated outline in pixels. Set to 0 for no outline.

*Shadow Alpha*
: The transparency of the generated shadow. 0.0--1.0.

::: sidenote
Shadow rendering of fonts is disabled in the default built-in material shaders because of performance reasons. It is fairly easy to write a custom shader that renders shadows (at some cost) if you need them.
:::

*Shadow Blur*
: The blur radius in pixels for the generated shadow.

*Shadow X/Y*
: The horizontal and vertical offset in pixels of the generated shadow.

*Extra Characters*
: By default the font will include the ASCII printable characters (character codes 32-126). To manually include additional characters, list them in this property field.

::: sidenote
The ASCII printable characters are:
space ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \ ] ^ _ \` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~
:::

*All Chars*
: If you check this property all glyphs available in the source file will be included in the output.

*Cache Width/Height*
: Constrains the size of the glyph cache bitmap. When the engine renders text, it looks up the glyph from the cache bitmap. If it does not exist there, it will be added to the cache before rendering. If the cache bitmap is too small to contain all the glyphs the engine is asked to render, an error is signalled (`ERROR:RENDER: Out of available cache cells! Consider increasing cache_width or cache_height for the font.`).

  If set to 0 the cache size is set automatically.

## Distance field fonts

Distance field fonts store the distance to the edge of the glyph in the texture instead of bitmap data. When the engine renders the font, a special shader is required to interpret the distance data and use that to draw the glyph. Distance field fonts are more resource intensive than bitmap fonts, but allow for greater sizing flexibility.

![Distance field font](images/font/df_font.png){srcset="images/font/df_font@2x.png 2x"}

Make sure to change the *Material* property of the font to *builtins/fonts/font-df.material* (or any other material that can handle the distance field data) when you create the font---or the font will not use the correct shader when it is rendered to screen.

## Bitmap BMFonts

In addition to generated bitmaps Defold supports prebaked bitmap "BMFont" format fonts. These fonts consists of a PNG font sheet with all the glyphs. In addition, a *.fnt* file contains information on where on the sheet each glyph can be found as well as size and kerning information. (Note that Defold does not support the XML version of the *.fnt* format that is used by Phaser and some other tools)

These types of fonts provide no performance improvement from bitmap fonts generated from TrueType or OpenType font files, but can include arbitrary graphics, coloring and shadows right in the image.

Add the generated *.fnt* and *.png* files to your Defold project. These files should reside in the same folder. Create a new font file and set the *font* property to the *.fnt* file. Make sure that *output_format* is set to `TYPE_BITMAP`. Defold will not generate a bitmap but use the one provided in the PNG.

::: sidenote
To create a BMFont, you need to use a tool that can generate the appropriate files. Several options exist:

* [Bitmap Font Generator](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/), a Windows only tool provided by AngelCode.
* [Shoebox](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/), a free Adobe Air based app for Windows and MacOS.
* [Hiero](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Hiero), an open source Java based tool.
* [Glyph Designer](https://71squared.com/glyphdesigner), a commercial MacOS tool from 71 Squared.
* [bmGlyph](https://www.bmglyph.com), a commercial MacOS tool from Sovapps.

![BMfont](images/font/bm_font.png){srcset="images/font/bm_font@2x.png 2x"}

For the font to render correctly, don't forget to set the material property to *builtins/fonts/font-fnt.material* when you create the font.

## Artifacts and best practices

Generally, bitmap fonts are best when the font is rendered with no scaling. They are faster to render to screen than distance field fonts.

Distance field fonts respond very good to upscaling. Bitmap fonts, on the other hand, being just pixelated images will increase in size so the pixels will grow as the font is scaled, resulting in blocky artifacts. The following is a sample at font size 48 pixels, scaled up 4 times.

![Fonts scaled up](images/font/scale_up.png){srcset="images/font/scale_up@2x.png 2x"}

When scaling down, bitmap textures can be nicely and efficiently scaled down and antialiased by the GPU. A bitmap font keeps its color better than a distance field font. Here is a zoom of the same sample font at size 48 pixels, scaled down to 1/5 of the size:

![Fonts scaled down](images/font/scale_down.png){srcset="images/font/scale_down@2x.png 2x"}

Distance field fonts need to be rendered to a target size that is big enough to hold distance information that can express the curves of the font glyphs. This is the same font as above, but at 18 pixels size and scaled up 10 times. It is clear that this is too small to encode the shapes of this typeface:
